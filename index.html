            <h1>Why is data important?</h1><p>Data is more important now than ever because we live in a world 
                increasingly driven by information.From powering artificial intelligence and machine 
                learning to guiding business strategies and public policies, data enables smarter, faster, 
                and more accurate decision-making. In today’s digital age, nearly every action—whether it's 
                a purchase, a click, or a social media post—generates
        data that can reveal patterns, trends, and insights. This has immense value across sectors, 
        from healthcare and finance to education and climate science. As challenges grow more complex
        and interconnected, data provides the foundation to innovate, solve problems, and stay competitive 
        in a rapidly evolving global landscape.</p>

        <div class="header">📊 The Role of Data in Artificial Intelligence (AI)</div>
        <p id="breakdownText">Data is the foundation of Artificial Intelligence. Without data, AI cannot 
            learn, make decisions, or improve. Here's a clear breakdown of its role:</p>
        <div class="ai-data">
            <ul>🔑 Training AI Models<br>
                <li>AI models (like neural networks or decision trees) learn patterns from data.</li>
                <li>The quality and quantity of data determine how accurate and intelligent the AI becomes.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>🔁 Enabling Machine Learning
                <li>Machine learning (a subset of AI) relies on data to learn from experience.</li>
                <li>The model adjusts its behavior based on data patterns, feedback, and corrections.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>🎯 Making Predictions & Decisions
                <li>AI uses data to make real-time predictions, like:</li>
                <li>The more accurate the data, the smarter and more reliable the AI decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>🔍 Improving Over Time
                <li>AI systems continuously learn from new data.</li>
                <li>This is called model retraining or online learning, which helps keep the AI updated and relevant.</li>   
            </ul>
            <ul>🚫 Bias and Ethics
                <li>If the data is biased, AI will reflect that bias.</li>
                <li>Data must be diverse, fair, and representative to ensure ethical AI.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
